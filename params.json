{"name":"Pearsforee","body":"Pears for EE\r\n============\r\n\r\nPears for EE is an ExpressionEngine theme conversion based upon\r\n[Pears][] by [SimpleBit][] and was originally a [Wordpress theme][].\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any assistance. Contact [me on twitter][] or via\r\n[my website][].\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n-   ExpressionEngine 2.x+\r\n-   Tested in 2.4.0\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n**For EE2**  \r\n\\* Un-zip a fresh copy of ExpressionEngine to your dev server.  \r\n\\* Place pears theme folder <code>themes/site*themes/pears</code> into\r\nyour <code>themes/site*themes/</code> directory.  \r\n\\* Install ExpressionEngine and select Pears as your theme from the\r\n“Choose your Site Theme” dropdown on the installer settings page.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou can create a new entry, set it’s category, add in the title, html\r\nand css and your done.\r\n\r\nIf you want you can also create a new category and it will show up in\r\nthe menu with entries of said category.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou can manually add images to an entry by using\r\n<code>{theme*folder*url}site\\_themes/pears/img/yourimage.jpg</code> and\r\nplacing the image in the img folder of the Pears theme or you can put\r\nthem in your prefered\r\nlocation<code>{site\\_url}some/image/folder/yourimage.jpg</code>\r\n\r\nI’ve included a 404 template though, if you turn it on in\r\nTemplates-\\>Global Preferences the theme won’t work properly. I have\r\ntried to mimic Pea.rs url structure as close as possible though, that\r\ncaused some issues due to the fact that everything is using the defualt\r\nindex.html.\r\n\r\nI’ve swapped out what appears to be Proxima Nova from typekit for PT\r\nSans from Google Web Fonts. The original theme didn’t include any fonts\r\nbut, the Pea.rs website did so, I’v added a font which is similar.\r\n\r\nThis theme doesn’t use any add-ons by default and the template isn’t\r\nsetup for performance or things of that nature. There are many practices\r\nwhich were used here that could be done different or even better though,\r\nfor sake of simplicity, being a theme, this is the way I have gone about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n----------\r\n\r\n+**Mar 16, 2012: 1.0.1**+\r\n\r\n-   Moved the CSS from the head to content area so you can live edit.\r\n\r\n**Feb 27, 2012: 1.0.0**\r\n\r\n-   Initial Release\r\n\r\nTo Do and Thoughts\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n-   Figure out if there is a way to achieve the current url structure\r\n    and have 404 template.\r\n\r\n  [Pears]: http://pea.rs\r\n  [SimpleBit]: http://simplebits.com/\r\n  [Wordpress theme]: https://github.com/simplebits/Pears\r\n  [me on twitter]: http://twitter.com/natetronn\r\n  [my website]: http://natetronn.com/\r\n","tagline":"Pears for EE is an ExpressionEngine theme","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
